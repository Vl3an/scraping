# scraping

## goal 

the goal of this project is to get buff listing through api and web scraping to evaluate their profitability. It'll cover 4x crafts and calculate overpay, while comparing price with csgo float listing. 

## ISSUE

the project can't go further as BUFF api doesn't allow us to get 4x craft listing without login. 

## what's next

we will try to convert this project into a web extension that will facilitate craft price evalutation as we can still get prices and listing manually.
Combined with the big csgo float database, it could still be helpfull to display overpay and 1/x for each skin.
